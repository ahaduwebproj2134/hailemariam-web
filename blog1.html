        <h2>Resource Review</h2>
        <h3><span>W3Schools</span></h3>
        <div class="education-content">
          <h6><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"><span>W3 Schools</span></a> is an open-access platform with hundreds
            of user solutions. A free resource, the site covers
            over fourteen
            programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C++. It includes numerous
            tutorials,
            exercises, practice materials and tools appropriate for learners just starting their education in
            programming. An online
            editor is provided within the site, enabling users to test out code examples before applying it to a
            project. The site
            contains a library of reference materials useful to intermediate and experienced web developers. One of the
            most noted
            strengths of W3Schools is that it is a free resource suited for beginners to HTML and CSS/web development.
            The site is
            easy to use, with code walkthroughs and straightforward visuals. It holds a large repository of information
            about web
            technology. Users may register for an account to track their progress. But the resource has also
            shortcomings. One is
            the lack of curriculum, which may be ideal for independent learners, but leaves many users without needed
            structure. In
            addition, while providing basic knowledge about HTML and CSS, it doesn't include advanced tutorials on
            subjects.
            Outdated content is also a drawback.</h6>

        <h3><span>MDN Web Docs (formerly Mozilla Developer)</span></h3>
        <div class="education-content">
          <h6><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"><span>MDN Web Docs</span></a> is an open resource housing an
            extensive repository of web development documentation,
            tutorials, and
            developer tools. These are made available free to any developer, regardless of brand, browser, or platform.
            Maintained
            by Mozilla, Google employees, and volunteers, content is constantly updated and improved. Topics covered
            include HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an extensive set of learning resources for beginning developers and
            students. Strengths
            include free access and the wide range of its resources, helpful for developers of any level. MDN Web Docs
            is
            particularly useful for specific queries concerning HTML or CSS features and capabilities in MDN. It is
            frequently
            updated to include current correct usage of the required technologies of HTML, CSS, and others. One weakness
            of MDN Web
            Docs would be a lack of a clear structure and curriculum. While it can provide an expertise level answer for
            your
            specific enquiries, it is an endless ocean of information.</h6>

        <h3><span>YouTube</span></h3>
        <div class="education-content">
          <h6><a href="https://www.youtube.com/"><span>YouTube</span></a> is a free video sharing
            website, allowing individuals, institutions and companies to upload content. As the
            largest online video platform worldwide, it includes material on just about any topic in any audio/visual
            modality. With
            regard to HTML and CSS, the amount of material, provided by schools, businesses, professionals and amateurs,
            is vast.
            The videos are usually free, though sometimes with advertising (removal of which requires payment), and
            viewers can
            subscribe to web development channels. The website has a global reach, with international contributors
            supplying
            materials in myriad languages. You tube's greatest strength as a web development resource would be the huge
            number of
            relevant videos. It includes numerous lectures and Tutorials on HTML and CSS/Web development, by professors,
            web
            developers and other experts which technologically enhance the learning process. For students who prefer to
            learn a
            subject with audio and/or visual components, a topic search on YouTube will produce a plethora of options.
            Unfortunately, YouTube’s strength is also its major weakness. The user must wade through an endless chaos,
            left to their
            own devices to identify which one is relevant or not. The more specific an inquiry, the more difficult it
            can be to find
            an answer. The other major weakness is reliability. The quality and credibility of videos runs every
            possible gamut
            imaginable, leaving the viewer to discern if the information is accurate and current.</h6>
