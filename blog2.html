        <h2>Thought Provoking Questions and Answers</h2>
        <h3><span>Why are there so many different programming languages out there?</span></h3>
        <div class="education-content">
          <h6>Since programmers are human beings, they may have different test in choosing between coding languages for
            style,
            performance, and many other reasons. Apart from this, some note that different programming languages are
            best suited for
            different functions. In that they reiterate Ruby and Java Script are best for building web sites while Java
            and C++ are
            well suited for financial trading or game development, so forth. Besides, the commercialization of computers
            may also be
            another factor for the proliferation of programming languages. Companies have their own profit ends, and
            hence it can
            rightly be argued that introducing new languages gives them a competitive advantage.</h6>

        <h3><span>What is the Role of Software Developer at the Implementation Phase?</span></h3>
        <div class="education-content">
          <h6>I want to discuss about the role of the developer in implementation phase of software development life
            cycle (SDLC).
            Implementation comes after the software development process have passed through the sages of requirement
            specification,
            system analysis and system design. At this stage the developer performs functions of coding and
            self-testing. The
            designed program has to be changed to an accrual program. Hence, the developer will start building the
            entire system by
            writing code using the chosen programming language based on design documents and outlined specifications. In
            here, the
            developer has to follow any coding guidelines set by the organization. By executing a self-testing, the
            developer, a
            verifies whether or not the coding brings the expected results as defined. Self-testing is different from
            testing by
            done QA engineers at the fifth stage of SDLC. While the goal of self-testing by the developer is to ensure
            the new
            feature is successfully integrated with the system, QA specialists conduct overall testing to identify
            errors from
            various aspects. Self-testing, as a process, involves debugging whereby the developer identify, analyse and
            fixes errors
            to produce a bug free software. The developer my use debugging tools such as code-based tracers, profilers,
            and
            interpreters.</h6>
